The project is a book database created using Java, Java Database Connectivity (JDBC), and Postgres SQL. Users will be able to add books, 
update books, delete books, and search for books by ID or Author.

PREREQUISITES:
Users must setup a Postgres Database locally and update the 'database.properties' file with said databse credentials. Users must also 
create a 'books' table using the 'table.sql' file. A Postgres JDBC driver is already included in the project files.
